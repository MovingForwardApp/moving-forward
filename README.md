# Moving Forward

> دليل الموارد الاجتماعية للمهاجرين

Moving Forward is an initiative promoted by CEAR (Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid, www.cear.es) with the motivation of making more accessible the social resources to which migrants and refugees are entitled.

All content (resources of different types such as emergency, legal, health, accommodation and others) is taken from the official CEAR guides.

The application facilitates the search for resources by categories, geolocated and in multiple languages, or suggests resources to which these people are entitled depending on their needs.
